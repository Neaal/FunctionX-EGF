### Overview

All proposals are to be **voted on-chain**. Prior to on-chain voting, it is paramount that the proposer follows the following set of guidelines to ensure a greater chance that their proposal will be passed.

These guidelines are written in order to:

1. Propose best practices for drafting a proposal
2. Address the issue of reaching quorum for the reasons stated below:
   1. public validators not controlling enough FX currently, and
   2. Internal and institutional validators are not voting to maintain neutrality
3. Allow for the FunctionX team to indirectly exercise their voting power (uniquely from a delegator’s standpoint, and not from a validator’s standpoint) with full knowledge that the proposal was reviewed preliminarily by skilled peers

In that perspective, each proposal shall lead to:

1. The designation of 3 team developers, for each proposal that reaches out to the committee: The internal developers are chosen based on their skillset; hence, a market-making proposal will be judged by traders/trading system engineers, while a say - NFT proposal will be judged by a smart contract developer.
2. The assignment: Team will designate voting power to each committee member such that each committee member will control 5% of the network’s voting power
3. Each committee member acts independently. The proposer will obtain 5% vote from each of the 3 committee members if their proposal passes each committee member’s assessment. If it passes all committee member’s assessment then the proposal would have achieved 15% “yes”.

The rest of the voting power would then come from the public delegators and validators.
{% endhint %}

### Process

Before setting up any proposal on-chain, it is strongly recommended to any proposer to proceed the following way:

1. Contact the team with an inquiry form
   1. The proposer must contact the Function X team by correctly filling in the [EGF proposal form](applications/application-template.md) for points 1-5 (inclusive) of the EGF proposal form
      1. [Fork](https://github.com/FunctionX/FunctionX-EGF/fork) this repository
      2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](applications/application-template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FunctionX/FunctionX-EGF/main/applications/application-template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
      3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
      4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review.
      5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_—the Markdown file you created from the template.
   2. The more information provided, the better guidance the team will be able to provide to the proposer.
2. Identify support opportunities
   1. Identify ways to help, beyond monetary support e.g. coding, interfaces, source code, etc.
   2. Request more information in the Inquiry Form
3. Formal proposal
   1. If identified as requiring financial support
   2. Requires proposer to submit the fully completed [EGF proposal form](egf-proposal-form.md)
4. Evaluation
   1. Provide feedback
   2. May request for more information
5. Technical interviews
   1. If required, depending on the [tier](./#tiered-amounts) requested, technical interviews will be scheduled
6. Funding decision
7. Onboarding
   1. We’ll write up a contract and do KYC before disbursing funds
   2. Funds will be disbursed according to [milestones](egf-proposal-form.md#development-roadmap)

### Tiered amounts
